This is where we store and manage scenes.
Each scene can have its own set of scene elements:
	Custom sounds
	Custom tilesets
	Custom art
	Custom effects
	Custom resourses (tres)
	And so on

Tilesets can be stored for all scenes in a separate "Tilesets" folder,
rather than in each scene's folder, if that's more convenient.

It's recommended to create a base scene in the root of this folder that can be reused for other scenes.
