Contains groups of game objects:
	Characters, creatures, etc.

We also store cameras, weather systems, player items, and so on here.
Basically, everything that "exists" in the game.

Within a specific object, we go down to the level of asset types:
	Art - contains creature art
	Data - contains primarily resources (tres)
	Sound - contains creature sounds. Can be divided into folders: Idle, Aggro, Combat, Death, etc.

Important!
It's recommended to create a class system here to catalog all items.
It's also recommended to create classes for all subtypes (if any) that inherit from the base class.
	Example:
	We have a general "Items" class that contains a list of all items.
	Further, for example, we have a "Crafting Item" folder, which will contain crafting tools (axe, hammer, etc.) and a script describing all crafting tools. This script should reference the general "Items" class.

	That is:
	class_name CraftingItem extends Item
